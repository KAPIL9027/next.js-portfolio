Portfolio Website

As part of my portfolio project, I have developed a dynamic website using Next.js, a React.js framework, and Typescript. Next.js provides several benefits over traditional React, including server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and optimized performance. This resulted in faster load times.

The combination of Next.js and TypeScript allowed me to incorporate error checking and type checking functionality that is not available in traditional JavaScript, which improved the reliability and maintainability of my codebase. Additionally, I utilized Sanity.io, a content management system, to manage my personal data and ensure that any updates or changes can be easily made on the server side, without requiring additional code changes.

To enhance the user experience, I incorporated framer motion for animations and used Tailwind CSS, a flexible CSS framework, to minimize repetitive code and enable easy customization of styles. By leveraging groq query language, I was able to directly access data from the Sanity studio.

Finally, I implemented a contact form using react-form hooks that enables users to send emails directly through the website.

## Deployment
https://next-js-portfolio-xi-tawny.vercel.app/





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
